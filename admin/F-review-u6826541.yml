comments:
  - 1. The best features of this code is the data updating and checking is very ingenious and this code deals with dragging
    piece and snap to it to a grid,it is very smart that it stores the information of each type of piece such as location, orintation
    in an array, so if we add all the strings together it will be a placement string, therefore we can utilise the Task 5 function(isPlacementStringVAlid)
    to determint wherther it is overlap and on board, which is very efficient and space-saving.It is very accurate because the code modifies all the information
    of the piece after rotation and movement which will result in the placement changing, so it will Ensure maximum data accuracy.

    2. The code is well-documented, every function has a comment on the top of the function name and the description is easy to understand
    and for some code that is hard to understand has some commnets. Besides, variables have comments as well.

    3.The class and method structure decomposition is every appropriate, methods which can modify same behavior are in the same class and the Modifiers
    of the all class and method are correct for example some  virables of board height and width has modifiers of "static final"

    4. All the methods and variables properly named, all the names of the author written is based on the description of what this method does or what this variable
    is going to do.
