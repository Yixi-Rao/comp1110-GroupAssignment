comments:
  - 1. The best features of this code is the use of drawing tool in JavaFx. The author made good use of built-in methods
  - like Rectangle and line in JavaFx. Futhermore, the data used in the task like the piece size, the gaming area,
  - length of external  and internal frame line are calculatd correctly which makes the Gui very clear and nice.
  - Moreover, the method makePlacement in the class achieve the renewal the piece placement which is the most hard
  - part in the task.
  -
  - 2. The whole class is well-ducumented. Every method in the class has a good description what it does on the top.
  - Besides, important data used in the class all have a clear description near it which makes the data clear.
  -
  - 3. The class and method structure decomposition are very appropriate. The important data, group setting, resource
  - location are defined first and then are followed by useful methods which is a great structure.
  -
  - 4. The choices of method names and variable names are very clear and suitable and keep consistent throughout the
  - whole class which make team members and code readers easily understandwhat they can do.
  -
  - 5. I did not find any errors in the class, the whole class functions correctly due to the requirment of task 5.
