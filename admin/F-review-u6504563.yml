comments:
  - 1. The best feature of this code is the appropriate setting of parameters, which makes the interface shown in
  -     a good way. Esprecially the data used in adjusting the Board, the author took everthing into consideration,
  -     and calculated the reasonable distance about the width, length and margin. And then use piecesSize to fit
  -     height and width of each different piece. Moreover, the method makechess set up the group that represents
  -     the places that make the board. So the Gui looks clear and beautiful.
  -
  -  2. The code is well-documented, every setting of parameters are followed by a detailed description and the codes
  -     are given a clear comment so that they are easy to understand.
  -
  -  3. The class and method structure decomposition are very appropriate. every parameter which needed to be setted and
  -     functions are defined first and then are followed by useful methods so that all the codes are shown in a clear
  -     way.
  -
  -  4. The choices of method names and variable names are easy to understand and keep consistent throughout the
  -     whole class.
  -
  -  5. All these codes can run successfully.
