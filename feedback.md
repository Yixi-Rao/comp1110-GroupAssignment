## LATE SUBMISSION (SEE GIT LOG)
## Tutor Comment
Well Done. Good code documentation. The hints part of the game could have been improved. I felt like I got the entire
solution instead of just hints. It is always good to remove print statements from final code. It can cause the
program to run slower. More appropriate commit message is appreciated (instead of just "update", it can be like "updated
this section in this task to ....". Authorship details clear. Keep it up!!
All the best for exams.

Presentation was engaging and clearly understandable.

 constrained the player is, the fewer options they have, and
 consequently the solution to the challenge is simpler.
 
-The game comes with five difficulty levels: _starter_, _junior_, _expert_, _master_, and _wizard_, and offers 24 challenges at each level, for a total of 120 prescribed challenges.   These challenges are provided for you in the [Solutions class](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-ass2/blob/master/src/comp1110/ass2/Solution.java#L28), and the different difficulty levels are tested in the [SolutionsTest](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-ass2/blob/master/tests/comp1110/ass2/SolutionsTest.java#L38) test.
